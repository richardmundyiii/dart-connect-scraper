## How to Run

### First Things First

- Be sure to run 'npm i' to download all dependencies needed.<br>
- You will need to adjust the size of your array based on the number of teams in your league (line 24 - app.js)<br>
- Be sure to update your MongoDB url if you wish to save the data that you've scraped. <br>

## Ice-Box Features

- Some of the data numbers have a percentage sign at the end and cannot be recognized as a number.
